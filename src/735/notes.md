primes p1,p2,p3...

p-factors pf1, pf2, pf3
(pfx is the greatest number so that pfx*px < p(x+1))

every number is one of
n1 = p1^x1 * p2^x2 * p3^x3 ...

it's factor is

f(n1) = p1^(2*x1 + 1) * p2^(2*x2) * p3^(2*x3) ...

dividable by every

n2 = p1^y1 * p2^y2 * p3^y3

with
y1 <= 2*x1 + 1
y2 <= 2*x2
y3 <= 2*x3 ....
and 
n2 <= n1
